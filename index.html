            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>Starting to code can be both exciting and overwhelming, but it’s a rewarding journey that opens up endless possibilities. At first, learning the basic concepts like variables, loops, and functions may seem challenging, but with consistent practice, they quickly become second nature. Choosing a beginner-friendly language like Python or JavaScript can make the process smoother, as they have simple syntax and strong communities for support. It’s important to start small—maybe by building a calculator or a to-do list app—and gradually take on more complex projects as your confidence grows. Most importantly, don’t be afraid to make mistakes, because every error is a learning opportunity on the path to becoming a skilled programmer.</p>

            <h2>Why I Love Programming</h2>
            <p>I love programming because it gives me the power to create. Whether I’m designing a website or learning how a game works behind the scenes, coding lets me turn my ideas into something real and interactive. I’ve always been fascinated by how websites are built—how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together to make pages look and function the way they do. Games have also inspired me to learn more about logic, design, and user experience. Programming feels like solving puzzles, where every bug is a challenge and every working feature feels like an achievement. The more I learn, the more I realize how many doors coding can open—from building tools that help people to creating entertainment that brings joy.</p>
