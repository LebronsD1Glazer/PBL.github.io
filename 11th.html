            <p>
                As an 11th grader learning web design, I’ve started to understand how websites are built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone—it structures the content on the page, like text, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) comes next and is what makes a website look good. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and even how a site responds to different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning to combine HTML and CSS has been really fun because I get to actually see what I’m building right in the browser. It’s like digital art mixed with logic. I also started experimenting with basic JavaScript to add interactivity, like making buttons work or creating pop-ups. Web design feels creative but technical, and it's cool knowing that these are the same tools used to build the websites we use every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got to experience something new this year: the Codeathon. We worked on it every day, and it pushed our creativity and teamwork. It paid off—we proudly won 3rd place!

            <h2>Learning from Mrs. Pathan</h2>
            <p>
                In 11th grade, I had the opportunity to learn from Mrs. Pathan, who introduced me to the world of web development. Under her guidance, I learned how to structure web pages using HTML and bring them to life with CSS. She made learning the different HTML tags—from headings and paragraphs to forms and tables—feel both simple and powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Pathan emphasized clean code and good design practices, teaching us not just how to make websites work, but how to make them look professional and user-friendly. Her classes were always engaging, and she encouraged us to build our own creative projects, which helped solidify what we were learning. Thanks to her, I discovered a real passion for front-end development and began to see how I could bring my ideas to life on the web.
