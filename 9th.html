            <h2>Freshman Year</h2>
            <p>
                I began my programming journey in 9th grade, diving straight into Java. It wasn't the easiest language to start with, but it taught me to think logically and solve problems step by step. I used Java to build the backend of my first simple website, learning how to handle data and user input. At first, I didn’t fully understand how everything connected—Java code, HTML pages, and how the browser interacted with it all—but over time, it started to click.

                Even though Java is more commonly used for applications than websites, starting with it gave me a solid foundation in programming that made learning other technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript much easier later on. That first project sparked a real interest in building things with code, and I've been hooked ever since.

            <h2>Learning from Mr. Dal</h2>
            <p>
                My programming journey started in 9th grade, thanks to Mr. Dal. He was the first person to introduce me to the world of coding, and he taught me everything from the ground up. We started with the basics, learning what code is, how it works, and writing our first programs in Java. At first, it was challenging to understand things like variables, loops, and if-statements, but I figured it out. I always tried my best to think critically and not be afraid of making mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                My patience and enthusiasm helped create an environment in the classroom where beginners like me could thrive. Looking back, those early lessons laid the foundation for everything I’ve learned since, and they made me realize that programming was something I really enjoyed and wanted to stick with.
