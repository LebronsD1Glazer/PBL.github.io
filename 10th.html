            <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
            <p>
                As a student who took object-oriented programming in 10th grade, I found it to be both challenging and fascinating. At first, the concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance felt cool, but once I started writing actual code, things began to make sense. I learned how to create classes to represent real-world things—like a Car or a Student—and give them attributes and actions. One of the coolest parts was inheritance, where one class could take on the properties of another, which helped me write less code and keep things organized.
            </p>
            <p>
                OOP helped me think about programs in a more structured way, and I realized how important it is in building larger, more complex applications. It definitely sparked my interest in programming, and I’m excited to keep learning more advanced concepts in the future.

            <h2>Learning from Mr. Dal</h2>
            <p>
                In 10th grade, my programming knowledge grew a lot deeper thanks to Mr. Dal, who introduced us to Object-Oriented Programming. At first, the idea of organizing code into classes and objects felt complex, but I got through it. Through hands-on projects and not-so-clear explanations, I started to see how software is built and why OOP is so powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
                That year really shifted how I thought about programming, and it gave me the confidence to take on bigger and more structured projects.
